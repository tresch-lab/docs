# Overall Steps

1. Transfer files to Shrek, connect to Shrek
2. Build and/or Enter docker container, navigate to correct directories
3. Start ipython, start trainining.

# Transfering files and connecting to Shrek

## Transfering files

`scp -r local_directory abs9091@Shrek:/home/abs9091/dlc_folder` -> i think this is right, but check the directory

## Connect to Shrek

 `ssh Shrek`
 
 Check GPU utilization-> `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi`

# Install Docker, Build Image, Run Container 

## Install Docker

`git clone https://github.com/MMathisLab/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0`

`cd Docker4DeepLabCut2.0`

## Build Image

`docker image build -t dlc_username/dlcdocker .`

## Run Container

(Pick XXXX to be a port not in use; change container name, user name, and GPU# not in use)

`GPU=1 bash ./dlc-docker run -d -p XXXX:8888 -e USER_HOME=$HOME/DeepLabCut --name containername dlc_username/dlcdocker`

# Entering docker container, navigating to correct directories

## Enter docker container

`docker exec --user $USER -it alex_container /bin/bash`

## Navigate to correct directory

`cd ../../../home/abs9091/dlc_folder` -> again i think this is rght, but not sure

## edit config.yaml
`vim config.yaml`

(vim hints: theres two modes, command mode and insert mode. by default you are in command mode, where you can move your cursor and enter vim commands. in order to enter insert mode and add text, use `i` to enter insert mode. now you can write text. To go back to command mode, hit `escape`. 

In order to save and quit, enter command mode with `escape` and type in `:x`)

edit the project_path (/home/abs9091/R01_2-14/R01_2-14), and video_sets (/home/abs9091/R01_2-14/R01_2-14/videos/R01_2-14.avi). 

## edit permissions for resnet
this is a weird step you have to do once per docker container.

`cd /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/`

`sudo download.sh`

`sudo chown YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME resnet_v1_50.ckpt`

# Start ipython, tmux, and training

## Start tmux

`tmux`

this starts a tmux window, lets split the window.

`ctrl-b + %`

this splits the window, in the right window run `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi`, then use `ctrl-b + <-` to navigate to left window (`ctrl-b + d` closes window; `ctrl-b + z` enlarges window)

## start ipython
navigate back to your project folder (same directory where config.yaml lives)

`sudo ipython`

and then inside ipython

`%env DLClight True`

`import deeplabcut`

`config = 'config.yaml'` <--use absolute path if need be

`videos = ['/videos']`

`deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(config)`

## start training

`deeplabcut.train_network(config)`

## checking on training

if you closed your terminal, then make sure you're re-logged back into the docker container. then use `tmux ls` to see the # of your tmux session (it'llbe listed on the left).It is potentially `1`.

Then use the command `tmux a -t NUMBER`, replacing number with just the number checked above (usually `1`). This will allow you to re-enter your tmux session.

## finished training, analyze videos

once training is finished, we want to analyze our videos and created a labeled video. Your ipython should still be open i believe at this point, and if so, run the following commands.

`deeplabcut.analyze_videos(config, videos)`

might take a little. If this does not work try using absolute path of config and videos like this `deeplabcut.analyze_videos('/home/abs9091/R02_03-14-DLC/config.yaml', ['/home/abs9091/R02_03-14-DLC/videos'])`

`deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(config, videos, draw_skeleton=True)`

## closing tmux

Once training/analyzing/labeling is finished, we want to close our tmux session in order to make sure we're no longer using the GPU. 

Use `Ctrl-B, D` in order to detach from your tmux session.

Then use `tmux kill-session -t NUMBER` in order to kill your tmux session.

I would quickly use `nvidia-smi` to double check you're no longer using the GPU`.

## transfer files back to local

Disconnect from both the docker/Shrek and then use 

`scp -r abs9091@Shrek:/home/abs9091/dlc_folder .` -> i havent tried this, but I think it should work.

Move project to ubuntu folder `mv dlc_folder ubuntu`
